| APOPCALEAPS | KU Leuven, Belgium | Probabilistic Model | - | APOPCALEAPS is a system designed to automatically create music using a programming language called CHRiSM. It uses high-level rules and probabilities to generate music. 
User Interface: You use a graphical interface to set up what kind of music you want (melody, bass, chords, drums, etc.).
Music Generation: The system uses the CHRiSM program to generate music based on the rules and probabilities you set.
Output: The generated music is turned into sheet music and a MIDI file (a digital music file). | - | [Link](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=89f9ec84102de51636ad6df033acb59ac541f200) | - | - |
