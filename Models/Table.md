| APOPCALEAPS | - **User Interface:** Graphical interface to set up what kind of music you want (melody, bass, chords, drums, etc.).<br/> - **Music Generation:** The system uses the CHRiSM program to generate music based on the rules and probabilities set. CHRiSM is a special programming language that combines logic programming with probabilities. It allows the system to make decisions based on probabilities, like choosing which note to play next.<br/> - **Output:** The generated music is turned into sheet music and a MIDI file (a digital music file). |
| Markov Melody Generator | - **Markov Chains in Music:** Notes are treated as states, and the probability of transitioning from one note to another is calculated. These probabilities form a transition matrix.<br/> - **Data Set:** The melodies are encoded from piano sheet music into a readable format, mapping notes to MIDI values.<br/> - **Generating Algorithm:** The algorithm analyzes a melody, creates a transition matrix, and generates new melodies by selecting notes based on these probabilities. The generated sequence is then converted into a MIDI file. |
