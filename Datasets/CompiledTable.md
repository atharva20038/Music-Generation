### Compiled Table for Datasets

The following table contains a compilation of all the datasets with categorization under different criteria to create a taxonomy of datasets based on the ontology given.
* "*" means that the following categorization is our assumption and is not mentioned in the readme or description of the datasets. 
* "-" means we were not able to deduce the category of the particular dataset given with the readme or examples and we need to move into an in-depth analysis of the dataset to decide the same.

| covers80 | [Link](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/projects/coversongs/covers80/) | As described on the main coversongs page, we have been researching automatic detection of "cover songs" i.e. alternative performances of the same basic musical piece by different artists, typically with large stylistic and/or harmonic changes. Although this task has been evaluated as part of MIREX since 2006, that is a closed task that is evaluated only once a year. To help in developing that task, we needed a standard data set with which to measure our progress. That is the purpose of the covers80 dataset, a collection of 80 songs, each performed by 2 artists. | - | 80(x2) | Music Composition, Audio Classification (Artist) | - | Non-Symbolic - Compressed (MP3) | Rhythm, Harmony, Vocals, Melody | Pop, Rock | European - Western | All Textures | Audio Classification for classifying audio based on artists. |
