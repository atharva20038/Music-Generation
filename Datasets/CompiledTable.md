### Compiled Table for Datasets

The following table contains a compilation of all the datasets with categorization under different criteria to create a taxonomy of datasets based on the ontology given.\n
* "*" means that the following categorization is our assumption and is not mentioned in the readme or description of the datasets. 
* "-" means we were not able to deduce the category of the particular dataset given with the readme or examples and we need to move into an in-depth analysis of the dataset to decide the same.

Although this task has been evaluated as part of MIREX since 2006, that is a closed task that is evaluated only once a year. To help in developing that task, we needed a standard data set with which to measure our progress. That is the purpose of the covers80 dataset, a collection of 80 songs, each performed by 2 artists. | -                | 80(x2)            | Music Composition, Audio Classification(Artist)                                               | -                                  | Non-Symbolic - Compressed(MP3)            | Rhythm, Harmony, Vocals, Melody                                                            | Pop, Rock   | European - Western   | All Textures                             | Audio Classification for classifying audio based on artists.                                                                      |
