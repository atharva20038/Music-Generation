### Compiled Table for Datasets

The following table contains a compilation of all the datasets with categorization under different criteria to create a taxonomy of datasets based on the ontology given.
* "*" means that the following categorization is our assumption and is not mentioned in the readme or description of the datasets. 
* "-" means we were not able to deduce the category of the particular dataset given with the readme or examples, and we need to move into an in-depth analysis of the dataset to decide on the same.
